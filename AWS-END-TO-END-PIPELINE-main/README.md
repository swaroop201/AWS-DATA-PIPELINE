Have fetched data from api usi Lambda Function and stored the data in aws S3.
Have Read the data from s3 and performed data transformations in aws glue using pyspark.
Have written the transformed data to the table created in Dynamo Db.
Scheduled the lambda function to download data automatically on specific intervals and schedule the glue job to shift data from s3 to redshift.
